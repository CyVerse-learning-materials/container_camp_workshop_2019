**Breakout sessions**
=====================

1. **Biocontainers** - Lead: Amanda Cooksey, CyVerse Scientific Analyst 

	`Biocontainer breakout session content <../breakout/biocontainers.html>`_

	In this breakout session, you'll learn about Biocontainers and apply what you've learned about basic container technology, such as Docker, with open source bioinformatics apps for Proteomics, Genomics, Transcriptomics, and Metabolomics.

2. **nvidi-docker** - Lead: Tyson Swetnam, CyVerse Scientific Analyst

	`nvidia docker breakout session content <../breakout/nvidia-docker.html>`_

	In this breakout session, you'll learn about NVIDIA GPU Cloud, and how to use NVIDIA-based containers in Docker and Singularity. 
	NVIDIA GPUs are widely used for 3D modelling and Machine Learning applications. We will discuss the complexities of working with these different container types, with hands on examples running CyVerse and HPC.

3. **Containerized workflows** - Lead: Sateesh Peri, CyVerse power user, University of Nevada-Reno

	`Containerized workflows breakout session content <../breakout/workflows.html>`_

	In this breakout session you'll learn about Snakemake, a workflow management system consisting of a text-based workflow specification language and a scalable execution environment. You will be introduced to the Snakemake workflow definition language and how to use the execution environment to scale workflows to compute servers and clusters while adapting to hardware specific constraints. 

4. **Docker for Data Science** - Lead: Upendra Devisetty, CyVerse Scientific Analyst

	`Docker for Data Science breakout session content <../breakout/datascience.html>`_

	Why do Data Scientists care about Docker? For a long time statisticians and Data Scientists have ignored the software aspect of data analysis. In this breakout session, you'll learn what's in Docker for Data Scientists. In particular how Docker helps Data Scientists to save time, enable reproducible research and distributing their environment to the outside world.

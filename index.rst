**Container technologies** are letting researchers easily share, scale, and reuse tools and workflows for all types of computational analyses. CyVerse Container Camp is an intensive three day hands-on workshop to learn how to create, us, and deploy containers across a variety of compute systems (your computer, local HPC cloud compute environments, and national resources such as OSG). 

In this 3-day workshop, users will blend practical theory and hands-on exercises where small groups deploy tools and workflows they bring to the workshop.

Expected outcomes:
------------------

- How to containerize applications and workflows
- How to use other containerized applications and workflows
- How to build/deploy containerized applications and workflows
- How to scale out your computation from laptop to cloud to HPC/OSG

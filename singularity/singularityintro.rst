**Introduction to Singularity**
-------------------------------

|singularity|

1. Prerequisites
================

There are no specific skills needed beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor. Prior experience installing Linux applications could be helpful but is not required.

.. Note:: 
      
      *Important*: `Singularity is compatible with Docker <https://www.sylabs.io/2018/04/singularity-compatibility-with-docker-containers/>`_, but they do have distinct differences. 
 
   Key Differences:
 
      **Docker**:
      
      * Inside a Docker container the user has escalated privileges, effectively making them `root` on that host system. This privilege is not supported by *most* administrators of High Performance Computing (HPC) centers. Meaning that Docker is not, and will likely never be, installed natively on your HPC.
      
      **Singularity**:
         
      * Same user inside as outside the container
      * User only has root privileges if elevated with `sudo` when container is run
      * Can run (and modify!) existing Docker images and containers

  These key differences allow Singularity to be installed on most HPC centers. Because you can run virtually all Docker containers in Singularity, you can effectively run Docker on an HPC. 

Singularity uses a 'flow' whereby you (1) create and modify images on your dev system, (2) build containers using recipes or pulling from repositories, and (3) execute containers on production systems.

2. Singularity Installation
===========================

Sylabs Singularity homepage: `https://www.sylabs.io/docs/ <https://www.sylabs.io/docs/>`_

While Singularity is more likely to be used on a remote system, e.g. HPC or cloud, you may want to develop your own containers first on a local machine or dev system (See figure above).

.. Note::

	Singularity exits as two major versions - 2 and 3. In this workshop we will be using version 3

2.1 Install Singularity on Laptop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To Install Singularity on your laptop or desktop PC follow the instructions from Singularity: https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#installation
  
2.2 HPC
~~~~~~~

Load the Singularity module on a HPC

If you are interested in working on HPC, you may need to contact your systems administrator and request they install `Singularity  <https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#installation>`_. Because singularity ideally needs setuid, your admins may have some qualms about giving Singularity this privilege. If that is the case, you might consider forwarding `this letter <https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#singularity-on-a-shared-resource>`_ to your admins.

Most HPC systems are running Environment Modules with the simple command `module`. You can check to see what is available:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ module avail singularity

If Singularity is installed:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ module load singularity/3/3.1

2.3 Atmosphere Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CyVerse staff have deployed an Ansible playbooks called ``ez`` installation which includes `Singularity <https://cyverse-ez-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/#>`_ that only requires you to type a short line of code.

Start a featured instance on `Atmosphere <../cyverse/boot.html>_`.

Type in the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ezs -r 3.1.0
	DEBUG: set version to 3.1.0

	* Updating ez singularity and installing singularity (this may take a few minutes, coffee break!)
	Cloning into '/opt/cyverse-ez-singularity'...
	remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
	remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
	remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
	remote: Total 24 (delta 1), reused 4 (delta 1), pack-reused 18
	Unpacking objects: 100% (24/24), done.
	* singularity was updated successfully

	You shouldn't need to use ezs again on this system, unless you want to update singularity itself

	To test singularity, type: singularity run shub://vsoch/hello-world
	Hint: it should output "RaawwWWWWWRRRR!!")


2.4 Check Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Singularity should now be installed on your laptop or VM, or loaded on the HPC, you can check the installation with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ singularity pull shub://vsoch/hello-world
	WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
	 62.32 MiB / 62.32 MiB [===============================================================================================] 100.00% 30.61 MiB/s 2s

Singularityâ€™s command line interface allows you to build and interact with containers transparently. You can run programs inside a container as if they were running on your host system. You can easily redirect IO, use pipes, pass arguments, and access files, sockets, and ports on the host system from within a container.

The help command gives an overview of Singularity options and subcommands as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

3. Downloading pre-built images
================================

The easiest way to use a Singularity is to ``pull`` an existing container from one of the Registries.

You can use the ``pull`` command to download pre-built images from a number of Container Registries, here we'll be focusing on the `Singularity-Hub <https://www.singularity-hub.org>`_ or `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_.

Container Registries: 

* `library` - images hosted on Sylabs Cloud
* `shub` - images hosted on Singularity Hub
* `docker` - images hosted on Docker Hub
* `localimage` - images saved on your machine
* `yum` - yum based systems such as CentOS and Scientific Linux
* `debootstrap` - apt based systems such as Debian and Ubuntu
* `arch` - Arch Linux
* `busybox` - BusyBox
* `zypper` - zypper based systems such as Suse and OpenSuse

3.1 Pulling an image from Singularity Hub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to previous example, in this example I am pulling a base Ubuntu container from Singularity-Hub:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ singularity pull shub://singularityhub/ubuntu
    WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
 	88.58 MiB / 88.58 MiB [===============================================================================================] 100.00% 31.86 MiB/s 2s

You can rename the container using the `--name` flag:
  
.. code-block:: bash

    $ singularity pull --name ubuntu_test.simg shub://singularityhub/ubuntu
    WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
 	88.58 MiB / 88.58 MiB [===============================================================================================] 100.00% 35.12 MiB/s 2s

The above command will save the alpine image from the Container Library as ``alpine.sif``

3.2 Pulling an image from Docker Hub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example pulls an ``ubuntu:16.04`` image from DockerHub and saves it to the working directory.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ singularity pull docker://ubuntu:16.04
	WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
	INFO:    Starting build...

.. warning::

	Pulling Docker images reduces reproducibility. If you were to pull a Docker image today and then wait six months and pull again, you are not guaranteed to get the same image. If any of the source layers has changed the image will be altered. If reproducibility is a priority for you, try building your images from the Container Library.

3.3 Pulling an image from Sylabs cloud library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Letâ€™s use an easy example of ``alpine.sif`` image from the `container library <https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/>`_

.. code-block :: bash

	$ singularity pull library://alpine:latest
	WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
	INFO:    Downloading library image
 	2.08 MiB / 2.08 MiB [==================================================================================================] 100.00% 5.06 MiB/s 0s

.. Tip::

	You can use ``singularity search alpine`` command to locate groups, collections, and containers of interest on the Container Library

4 Interact with images
======================

You can interact with images in several ways such as ``shell``, ``exec`` and ``run``. 

For these examples we will use a ``lolcow_latest.sif`` image that can be pulled from the Container Library like so.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ singularity pull library://sylabsed/examples/lolcow

4.1 Shell
~~~~~~~~~

The ``shell`` command allows you to spawn a new shell within your container and interact with it as though it were a small virtual machine.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ singularity shell lolcow_latest.sif 
	  Singularity lolcow_latest.sif:~>

The change in prompt indicates that you have entered the container (though you should not rely on that to determine whether you are in container or not).

Once inside of a Singularity container, you are the same user as you are on the host system.

.. code-block:: bash

	$ Singularity lolcow_latest.sif:~> whoami
	upendra_35
	Singularity lolcow_latest.sif:~> id
	uid=14135(upendra_35) gid=10013(iplant-everyone) groups=10013(iplant-everyone),100(users),119(docker),10000(staff),10007,10054,10064(atmo-user),10075(myplant-users),10083(tito-admins),10084(tito-qa-admins),10092(geco-admins),10100(sciteam)

.. Note::

	``shell`` also works with the library://, docker://, and shub:// URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that disappears when the shell is exited.

4.2 Executing commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exec command allows you to execute a custom command within a container by specifying the image file. For instance, to execute the ``cowsay`` program within the lolcow_latest.sif container:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ singularity exec lolcow_latest.sif cowsay container camp rocks
 	______________________
	< container camp rocks >
	 ----------------------
	        \   ^__^
	         \  (oo)\_______
	            (__)\       )\/\
	                ||----w |
	                ||     ||

.. Note::

	``exec`` also works with the library://, docker://, and shub:// URIs. This creates an ephemeral container that executes a command and disappears.

4.3 Running a container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Singularity containers contain `runscripts <https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/definition_files.html#runscript>`_. These are user defined scripts that define the actions a container should perform when someone runs it. The runscript can be triggered with the ``run`` command, or simply by calling the container as though it were an executable.

.. code-block:: bash

	singularity run lolcow_latest.sif 
	 _________________________________________

# Exercises
###########

Now that you know how to run containers from Docker, I want you to run a Singular container from `simple-script` Docker image that you create on Day 1 of the workshop. Here are the brief steps

1. Go to `Docker hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ and look the Dockerhub image that you built on Day 1

2. Use ``singularity pull`` command to pull the Docker image onto your working directory on the Atmosphere

3. Use ``singularity run`` command to launch a container from the Docker image and check to see if it is working

4. If you have access to HPC, then you can try to run the container on HPC and see if it works there.

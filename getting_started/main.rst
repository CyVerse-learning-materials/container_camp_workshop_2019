**FAIR Data principles**

Container Camp supports FAIR data principles by providing services that help make data 
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Participants will get an introduction 
to containers and learn how to create and manage containers, enabling interoperability and reusability of data.

**Learning objectives**

Participants will learn key containerization concepts for developing 
reproducible analysis pipelines, with emphasis on container lifecycle 
management from design to execution and scaling. 

The workshop will cover key concepts about containers such as defining the 
architecture of containers, building images and pushing them to 
public and private repositories as well as how to scale your 
analysis from laptop to cloud and to HPC systems using containers. 

**Who should attend?**

Faculty, researchers, postdocs, and graduate students who use and analyze data of all
types (genomics, astronomy, image data, Big Data, etc.).

**Workshop level**

This workshop is focused on beginner-level users with little to no previous container
experience.

Intermediate and advanced users who attend will gain a better understanding of and ability with container capabilities 
and resources, including deploying their own tools and extending these analyses 
into Cloud and HPC.

**Workshop Code of Conduct and Other Information**
============================

All attendees, speakers, staff and volunteers at Container Camp are required to follow our code of conduct. 

CyVerse expects and appreciates cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe, collaborative environment for everyone. Harrassment by any individual will not be tolerated and may result in the individual being removed from the Camp.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Workshop staff are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, staff should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.

If you are being harassed, or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the workshop staff immediately. Staff can be identified as they'll be wearing badges or nametags.

Workshop staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

**FAIR Data principles**

Container Camp supports FAIR data principles by providing services that help make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Participants will get an introduction to containers and learn how to create and manage containers, enabling interoperability and reusability of data.

**Learning objectives**

Participants will learn key containerization concepts for developing reproducible analysis pipelines, with emphasis on container lifecycle management from design to execution and scaling. 

The workshop will cover key concepts about containers such as defining the architecture of containers, building images and pushing them to public and private repositories as well as how to scale your analysis from laptop to cloud and to HPC systems using containers. 

**Container Camp Goes Green**

This year, we encourage all Container Camp participants to help minimize our waste footprint. If possible, bring your own reusable beverage containers, such as coffee mugs and water bottles, to use during snack breaks. Thanks in advance!

**Who should attend?**

Faculty, researchers, postdocs, and graduate students who use and analyze data of all types (genomics, astronomy, image data, Big Data, etc.).

**Workshop level**

This workshop is focused on beginner-level users with little to no previous container experience.

Intermediate and advanced users who attend will gain a better understanding of and ability with container capabilities  and resources, including deploying their own tools and extending these analyses into Cloud and HPC.

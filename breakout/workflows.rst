**Reproducible Workflows using Snakemake and Singularity**
----------------------------------------------------------

|logo|

**The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses and can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition.**

**Singularity is an open source-based container platform designed for scientific and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Singularity supports Bring Your Own Environment (BYOE)—where entire Singularity environments can be transported between computational resources (e.g., users’ PCs) with reproducibility.**

+ Basic `UNIX command-line <http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php>`_ experience required. `Bootcamp <http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=6oprpl4mlf4>`_
+ You don't need to be an expert at Python to use Snakemake, but it can sometimes be very useful.
